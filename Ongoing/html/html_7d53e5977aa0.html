<p>Errata: This page is a quick hack. This is limitied just
      to the edX run of the Insider course. Pending XBlocks data
      model, the way we manage this page is completely manual. We
      periodically run a script on the read replica. We generate the
      above from the output of the script. This is an occasional
      process (we do this once in a while). It does not update in real
      time. </p><p> 
	We understand this page is horrific. We don't recommend
	exposing anyone other than trained software engineers to this
	page.
