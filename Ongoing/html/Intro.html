	In the previous section, we mentioned the MITx platform originally didn't support multiple choice questions (although, as we found, they do have good uses). In this section, we'll explain the theoretical basis of why. We'll start off with a few now well-established theories about learning and motivation from a few different disciplines. These will, perhaps, seem like a disconnected drink from a firehouse. Bear with us. This does come together....
